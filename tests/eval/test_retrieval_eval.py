"""Retrieval eval harness — the Harden gate for `retrieval/t2url.py`.

Two tiers:

* **Contract tests** (always run) assert the guarantees every caller depends on,
  against a stubbed engine. Fast, deterministic, safe in CI.
* **Live tests** (`--live` only) call real search engines to measure availability
  and check the fallback chain earns its place. Off by default — CI must never
  fail because a provider is rate-limiting.

```bash
make test                 # contract tier only
pytest tests/eval --live  # add the live tier
```

The numbers the model card records come from `retrieval/notebooks/eval.ipynb`.
This file asserts the properties; the notebook measures them.
