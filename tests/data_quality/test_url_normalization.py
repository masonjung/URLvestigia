"""Data quality — `pipelines/jobs/url_enrichment.py` normalisation.

These run the same functions the Spark job ships to its executors as UDFs, with
no cluster involved. A URL that normalises wrong produces a duplicate row in
`curated_urls` that no downstream query can distinguish from a real one, so this
is the cheapest place to catch it.
