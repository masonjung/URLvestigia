"""The Harden gate for `scripts/doctor.py` — the pre-demo preflight.

A diagnostic that crashes when the network is down is worse than no diagnostic at
all: a broken network is precisely when it gets run. These tests sever the network
and assert it still reports, cleanly, in full.

No test here touches a real service. The one that would is `make doctor` itself.
