"""Pre-demo preflight — can this machine actually reach every corpus, right now?

Answers the question a failed demo leaves you with: was that an empty result, or a
dead network? Probes each provider, and each web engine *individually* so a single
blocked engine is visible by name instead of hidden inside the pool.

Reports conditions rather than working around them. A TLS-interception failure is
named as what it is; nothing here disables certificate verification.

Stdlib only, plus the ddgs library the web provider already needs.
