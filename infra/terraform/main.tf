# T2URL — CDP stack as code.
#
# The declarative equivalent of infra/cdp/provision.sh. Use whichever fits the
# customer: the shell script is easier to read in a workshop, Terraform is what
# survives contact with a platform team.
#
#   terraform init
#   terraform plan     # → what make provision dry-runs
#   terraform apply
#
# Environment creation takes roughly an hour. That is CDP, not Terraform.
