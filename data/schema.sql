-- `provider` is denormalised from the parent search on purpose: after

-- There is deliberately no `engine` column — ddgs pools results from several
-- engines before returning them and discards which one produced each URL, so
-- any value here would be invented. `searches.backend` records the engines
-- asked, which is a different and weaker claim.
