"""Retrieval providers — one search corpus each, behind a common interface.

`ddgs` reaches web engines by requesting their public result pages. That is free and
keyless, but every engine in the fallback chain fails the same way: rate-limited,
IP-blocked, or broken by a markup change. A chain of four does not help when the
trigger is the caller's egress IP, which is exactly the profile a datacenter address
presents.

The providers here break that correlation. Wikipedia, OpenAlex, and arXiv are
documented, versioned APIs run by non-profits whose published terms invite
programmatic use. They do not block datacenter IPs. They are also *different
corpora*, not substitute web engines — which is why a search picks one provider
rather than chaining across them. See "Providers are an axis, not links in the
chain" in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.

Each provider returns a plain list of absolute http(s) URLs, in the order the
provider ranked them. Deduplication and the `max_results` ceiling are applied once,
in t2url.py, so every provider inherits the same guarantees.

Stdlib only. retrieval/requirements.txt stays at one dependency so this layer keeps the
property retrieval/README.md claims for it: importable and testable with nothing else
installed.
