"""urlvestigia — natural-language text in, a list of URLs out, via free web search.

Free to run: no API keys, no accounts. Web searches go to the engines' public pages
through the ddgs metasearch library; Wikipedia, OpenAlex, and arXiv are reached
through their own keyless APIs in providers.py. Persistence lives in data/db.py;
this module is search only.

One search uses one provider. Within `ddgs`, `backend` selects engines that are
queried *concurrently* and pooled — not tried in order until `max_results` is filled;
see "Multi-engine is resilience" in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md. Across providers there is
no chain at all, because they are different corpora: falling through from a web
engine to arXiv would answer a web-search miss with physics preprints.

# backend: which engine(s) to query — a single name or a comma-delimited list,
#             e.g. "duckduckgo" or "duckduckgo,yahoo,startpage,yandex"; with a list,

#             Wikipedia is exposed as its own provider instead, via the MediaWiki

# reporting an ordinary empty result set to the user as a hard error, in red, next
# to the app's own "No results found." saying the opposite. If a future ddgs
# reworded it, this stops matching and the behaviour reverts to what it is today.
