# Walkthrough — T2URL across every layer

Follow one search from a form post to a governed row in `curated_urls`. Every command
here runs on a laptop; nothing needs a CDP environment until the last section.

Budget about 20 minutes.

---

## 0. Set up

```bash
pip install -r app/requirements.txt -r tests/requirements.txt
make test          # 186 passing, 13 skipped (the live tier)
```

If that is green, every layer imports and every contract holds. Start here — a
failure now saves you debugging the wrong thing in step 3.

---

## 1. The retrieval layer, on its own

The capability, with no server and no database:

```bash
python scripts/example.py
```

```python
# scripts/example.py, in full
from t2url import text_to_urls

for url in text_to_urls("Cloudera CDP supports use cases", max_results=16):
    print(url)
```

That is the whole retrieval layer's public surface. **This call hits a live search engine** —
if it returns nothing, an engine is throttling you, which is exactly the failure mode
the fallback chain exists for:

```python
text_to_urls("Cloudera CDP use cases", backend="duckduckgo,yahoo,startpage")
```

`ddgs` tries each in order and stops once it has enough. → [`retrieval/README.md`](../retrieval/README.md)

---

## 2. The Serve layer

```bash
make dev        # → http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Type a question, pick engines, hit **Search**. What happens:

1. `POST /search` — every option is whitelisted against `OPTIONS` in
   [`app/server.py`](../app/server.py); `max_results` is clamped to 1–50.
2. Checked engines are filtered, deduplicated, and joined into a fallback chain.
   Order is preserved because order is meaningful.
3. `t2url.text_to_urls()` runs.
4. `db.save_search()` persists the query, its full option set, and the URLs.
5. **303 redirect** back to `/` with a flash message — reloading never re-runs the
   search.

Try a few things that should not work:

- Submit an empty box → nothing reaches a search engine.
- Ask for 9999 results → clamped to 50.
- Search `<script>alert(1)</script>` → rendered escaped, not executed.

All three are asserted in [`tests/test_server.py`](../tests/test_server.py).

---

## 3. The Lakehouse layer, local tier

The searches you just ran are in SQLite:

```bash
sqlite3 data/t2url.db "SELECT id, query, backend, region FROM searches ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;"
sqlite3 data/t2url.db "SELECT position, url FROM search_urls WHERE search_id = 1 ORDER BY position;"
```

Two tables, parent and child, cascade on delete. Every statement the application runs
lives in [`data/db.py`](../data/db.py) — nowhere else.

Now run two searches likely to share a result, and press **Dedupe URLs** in the UI.
It keeps the earliest occurrence of each URL and removes any search left empty. That
is the local tier's answer to duplication; step 5 shows the lakehouse's better one.

---

## 4. Ingest — crossing to the platform tier

```bash
make ingest
```

```
T2URL ingest — DRY RUN (no writes)
====================================================
source     data/t2url.db
target     spark_catalog.t2url
watermark  (none — full load)

table                            rows
--------------------------------------
spark_catalog.t2url.raw_searches    3
spark_catalog.t2url.raw_search_urls 27
```

The dry run needs nothing but the standard library, which is the point — you can read
exactly what would be written before any cluster exists. `--execute` needs Spark and
the tables from [`data/iceberg/ddl.sql`](../data/iceberg/ddl.sql).

---

## 5. Process — where the interesting work is

```bash
make pipelines
```

This prints the literal `MERGE` statement that would run, plus the normalisation
sample:

```
normalisation sample
  in   https://WWW.Example.com/Docs/?utm_source=news&topic=iceberg#intro
  out  https://example.com/Docs?topic=iceberg
```

**Compare this to step 3.** `db.dedupe_urls()` compares raw strings, so those two URLs
would both survive as separate rows. The Spark job strips `www.`, tracking parameters,
and the fragment first — and then *aggregates rather than deletes*:

| | Local dedupe | Enrichment job |
|---|---|---|
| Compares | raw strings | normalised URLs |
| Duplicates | deleted | counted (`times_seen`) |
| Keeps | earliest row | earliest **and** latest sighting, best rank, every `search_id` |
| Re-runnable | yes | yes — `MERGE` converges |

Duplicates are signal. A URL six different searches returned is more interesting than
one returned once, and the local tier throws that away.

The normalisation functions are plain Python, shipped to Spark as UDFs, and tested
without a cluster:

```bash
pytest tests/data_quality -q
```

## 6. Governance

Read [`governance/DATA_CLASSIFICATION.md`](../governance/DATA_CLASSIFICATION.md).
The shape of the whole policy set follows from one fact: **exactly one column is
sensitive** — `raw_searches.query`, free text a user typed. Everything else is public
web addresses or configuration.

So [`governance/sdx/ranger-policies.json`](../governance/sdx/ranger-policies.json)
stays narrow: analysts read the URL tables outright and see `query` only as a hash;
engineers see everything; the app's service account can append to raw and nothing
else. Narrow, and defensible in a review.

Then read [`governance/model_cards/t2url-retrieval.md`](../governance/model_cards/t2url-retrieval.md) —
in particular **what it must not be used for**. T2URL cannot tell you a document does
not exist. Absence from the results means an engine did not rank it in the top N.

Note what the model card does *not* have: a dated evaluation. That is a real gap, and
it is why T2URL sits at ⚠️ on the Harden gate.

---

## 7. Deploy — the shape of it

```bash
make -n deploy     # print the make targets without running them
make deploy        # the deploy script's own dry run — every command, no changes
```

Three steps, in this order:

```
govern → jobs → app
```

Access control lands before data moves; data lands before anything serves it. A
deploy that publishes the app first shows a stakeholder an empty dashboard and a
policy gap simultaneously.

Provisioning is separate and runs **once** per environment:

```bash
make provision     # dry run — every CDP CLI call, printed
```

→ [`infra/README.md`](../infra/README.md), [`.cicd/README.md`](../.cicd/README.md)

---

## 8. Start your own

```bash
make new VERTICAL=healthcare USECASE=readmission-risk
```

Creates `../cloudera-forge-healthcare-readmission-risk/`: the layout and every
directory's `README.md` guidance, with T2URL's own code cleared out, re-pointed to
your name, and a fresh git history.

Then work directory by directory, using each `README.md` as the guide and
[`GATES.md`](GATES.md) as the bar for each handoff.

---

## What this example is meant to teach

| The pattern | Where you saw it |
|---|---|
| Two storage tiers, one schema shape — laptop *and* lakehouse | steps 3–4 |
| The Process layer does more than move data | step 5 |
| Classify before you store, and let it shape the policy set | step 6 |
| Pure functions test without a cluster; Spark ships the same code | step 5 |
| Dry run by default for anything that changes the world | steps 4, 5, 7 |
| Provisioning and deploying are different operations | step 7 |
| Stating known gaps beats having them found | step 6 |

The search logic is 40 lines. Everything else here is the accelerator.
